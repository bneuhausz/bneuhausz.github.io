First, [we've created and installed our PWA app](https://bneuhausz.dev/blog/angular-pwa-tutorial-part-1). Then, [we've notified our users about a new version being available](https://bneuhausz.dev/blog/angular-pwa-tutorial-part-2). Later, we implemented the [backend](https://bneuhausz.dev/blog/angular-pwa-tutorial-part-3) and the [frontend](https://bneuhausz.dev/blog/angular-pwa-tutorial-part-4) for the web push notification feature. In the last post of this series, we've looked at [controlling the appearance and installability of our application.](https://bneuhausz.dev/blog/angular-pwa-tutorial-part-5)

Today, we discuss caching strategies and the role of the ngsw-config.json file.

As always, the complete source code will be available [here.](https://github.com/bneuhausz/pwa-tutorial/tree/part-6)

## The key feature that makes PWAs possible

So far, we've only mentioned the existence of a service worker, but we've mostly ignored it. Let's talk about it now.

The service worker is standard browser feature, so it is not specific to Angular. At the end of the day, it is a simple JavaScript script. What makes it special is that it runs on a separate thread from the browser UI, which allows it to perform tasks in the background, without blocking the UI.

When a service worker is installed, it sits between the web app and the network, taking on the role of a proxy. It can intercept and modify HTTP requests, and it can serve responses from its cache. Yes, this means the service worker can cache our entire application and make it available to our users, even when they are offline.

Service workers are also what listen for push notifications in the background and display them even if the app is not opened in any browser tab. Whether the notification can be displayed even if the browser is not opened at all depends on the operating system and your browser's settings.

You can take a look at the registered service worker on the Application tab of the dev tools of your browser. For example, in Chrome:

![application tab](/images/pwa-tutorial/part-6/application_tab.png)

## Angular's spin on service workers

When we've run the ``ng add @angular/pwa`` schematic with the Angular CLI, it generated the ``ngsw-config.json`` file in our project root. This file provides a high-level, declarative way to define our caching strategies. When we build our application, the Angular CLI generates the actual service worker based on this file. You can find this generated ``ngsw-worker.js`` file in the ``dist/pwa-tutorial/browser`` folder.

Now let's take a look at our ``ngsw-config.json`` file in its default state, then I'll explain the contents:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@angular/service-worker/config/schema.json",
  "index": "/index.html",
  "assetGroups": [
    {
      "name": "app",
      "installMode": "prefetch",
      "resources": {
        "files": [
          "/favicon.ico",
          "/index.csr.html",
          "/index.html",
          "/manifest.webmanifest",
          "/*.css",
          "/*.js"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "assets",
      "installMode": "lazy",
      "updateMode": "prefetch",
      "resources": {
        "files": [
          "/**/*.(svg|cur|jpg|jpeg|png|apng|webp|avif|gif|otf|ttf|woff|woff2)"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

First, there is ``$schema``. This just points to a schema file that enables validation and autocompletion in your editor of choice. Second, there is ``index``. This is fairly straightforward, it specifies the entry point of the app.

Here begins the interesting part.

In ``assetGroups``, we can define different groups of our assets and apply our rules to all of the files or URLs listed in the given group. First things first, we have to add a name, which identifies the group.

Then comes ``install`` mode, which has two possible values:
- ``prefetch``
- ``lazy``

If we set our group to ``prefetch``, then the service worker will fetch every resource listed in the group when it is caching the current version of the application. This is how we can make our application available in offline mode to our users. Since the ``app`` group is set to ``"installMode": "prefetch"`` and our important files are all listed in its ``resources``, all of these files will be downloaded and cached and these can be served by the service worker, even if our application is offline. On top of offline functionality, this can also greatly reduce the initial loading time of our application.

Now, our ``assets`` group is set to ``"installMode": "lazy"``, so it is doing something entirely different. In the ``resources`` in this group are our image files. The ``lazy`` mode makes sure that we do not load all of these, usually bigger files, unless they are needed. So if we have a big picture shown on one our pages, but those are not necessary for functionality, we can add the important js and html files to our ``app`` group, add the images to our ``assets`` group and our page will be available without the pictures even if our user is offline and never opened this particular page. However, these pictures still get cached. The ``lazy`` mode just means these files get downloaded and cached when they are needed for the first time. So, if the user opens the page when they are online, the image still gets cached and the next time they open the page, it won't have to be downloaded again, which makes loading the page faster, but also, it will be available even in offline mode.

If ``installMode`` is not set, it defaults to ``prefetch``, so if you have lots of big images for example, you should pay extra attention when setting this up.

Notice, that our ``assets`` group also has the ``updateMode`` property set to ``prefetch``. This property has the same two values available and defaults to whatever the group's ``installMode`` is. In our case, we don't need to set it in our ``app`` group, but we want the ``assets`` group to behave differently, so it is set to ``prefetch``.

When it comes to ``updateMode``, ``prefetch`` means that if the service worker notices there is a new version of a resource available, it will fetch and cache it immediately. With this setup, our resources in the ``assets`` group will only be downloaded and cached for the first time, when the application explicitly needs them, but after that, if there is an updated version of a cached resource, those will be updated immediately.

The ``lazy`` value is only valid, if the ``installMode`` is set to ``lazy`` to begin with. In this mode, the resources are only updated in the cache if they were requested again.

Lastly, the ``resources`` object can contain two arrays, ``files`` and ``urls``. The file array is self-explanatory. The resources listed in the ``urls`` array are not fetched directly from our application directory, but these will be cached according to their HTTP headers, so it is useful when loading scripts or fonts from CDNs for example.

This concludes our default file that the Angular CLI created for us, but before we move on, ``cacheQueryOptions`` within ``assetGroups`` still worth mentioning. This is an object, that currently only has a single property, ``ignoreSearch``, which is a boolean. This lets you control if the query parameters should be ignored or not.

Keep in mind, that these are evaluated in a top-down way, so you should put the more specific definitions first.

## Beyond the defaults

We'll take a look at the ``appData`` and the ``dataGroups`` sections, but first, [I'll leave the documentation of this config here.](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/config) There are options we're not covering, so make sure to take a look at it to get familiar with what's available to you. Now, this has been a lot of reading and theory, so let's get to actually developing something.

### The appData section

This section lets you include any data you need to and the ``SwUpdate`` service will include it in the update notifications. To see it in practice, this to our ``ngsw-config.json`` file, under ``$schema``:

```json
"appData": {
  "version": "1.0.0"
},
```

Then modify our ``app.ts``. First, add an interface for our AppData type outside of the class definition, then create the ``newVersion`` signal and alter our constructor to look like this:

```ts
interface AppData {
  version: string;
}
```

```angular-ts
protected readonly newVersion = signal('');

constructor() {
  if (this.swUpdate.isEnabled) {
    this.swUpdate.versionUpdates
      .pipe(filter(event => event.type === 'VERSION_READY'))
      .subscribe((event: VersionReadyEvent) => {
        this.newVersion.set((event.latestVersion.appData as AppData)?.version ?? ''); // <----- ADD THIS LINE
        this.isNewVersionReady.set(true);
      });
  }
}
```

Now we can add our new signal to the template. Alter the new version notification to look like this:

```angular-html
<span>ðŸ†• Version ({{ newVersion() }}) is available! Please reload the application.</span>
```

Now, if you rebuild our application and restart ``http-server`` as usual, you'll see... nothing. That's because the previous version is cached. When you get notified, that a new version is available, reload the application and alter ``appData`` in ``ngsw-config.json``:

```json
"appData": {
  "version": "2.0.0"
},
```

Now rebuild and restart ``http-server`` again. When our new version notification pops up, you should see something like this:

![new version notification with version](/images/pwa-tutorial/part-6/pwa_appData.png)

### The dataGroups section

This is somewhat similar to ``assetGroups``, but ``dataGroups`` let us API requests for example. These are not cached along with the application, so we have to manually configure our caching policies. We'll take a look at a simple example but there are a lot of options to be aware of, so make sure to explore the documentation I've already linked above.

For this example, we will use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as our mock backend. Specifically, we will use the ``/todos`` endpoint. To start, let's add our group definition to ``ngsw-config.json`` on the same level as ``assetGroups``:

```json
"dataGroups": [
  {
    "name": "todos",
    "urls": [
      "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"
    ],
    "cacheConfig": {
      "maxSize": 1,
      "maxAge": "1d",
      "strategy": "freshness",
      "timeout": "5s"
    }
  }
]
```

Let me explain this. The ``name`` property is basically the same as in the case of ``assetGroups``.

The ``urls`` array contains the URL patterns that belong in this group. In our case, we use an exact string, but if we would want to, we could do something like ``https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/**`` to cache every request sent to JSONPlaceholder. It's important to note, that only non-mutating requests will be cached. In practice, that means ``GET`` and ``HEAD``.

Our ``cacheConfig`` setup is very simple. The ``maxSize`` parameter sets the maximum number of entries in the cache. Since we are only worried about a single URL, 1 is more than enough. The ``maxAge`` parameter configures how long a response can remain in the cache. In this example, it will be cached for 1 day.

Now, ``strategy`` is more interesting. It can have 2 values:
- ``freshness``
- ``performance``

If it is set to ``performance`` and there is a cached resource already, the response will be served from the cache without actually making the network request. This should be only used if the data doesn't necessarily have to be up to date, so some staleness is acceptable. Think along the lines of avatars for example. Either way, it should be paired with ``maxAge`` to make sure that sooner or later our resource gets updated.

In our example, we set it to ``freshness``. This means, that we prefer fetching the data from the network, but if the network times out, we fall back to the cached resource. That brings us to ``timeout``, which controls how long the service worker waits before serving the response from the cache. In this case, this will wait for 5 seconds.

To see this in action, we'll have to make a few changes. First of all, let's create a new ``todos.ts`` file next to our ``app.ts`` with the content being:

```angular-ts
import { httpResource } from "@angular/common/http";
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

interface Todo {
  userId: number;
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

@Component({
  selector: 'app-todos',
  template: `
    <h2>Todos</h2>
    <ul>
      @for (todo of todos.value(); track todo.id) {
        <li>{{ todo.title }}</li>
      }
    </ul>
  `,
})
export class Todos {
  protected readonly todos = httpResource<Todo[]>(() => 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos');
}
```

We just define an ``interface`` for our ``Todo`` type, add an ``httpResource`` that fetches our todos from JSONPlaceholder and render them in our template. Then we should turn to ``app.ts`` and add the ``showTodos`` signal and the ``toggleTodos`` function:

```angular-ts
protected readonly showTodos = signal(false);

toggleTodos() {
  this.showTodos.set(!this.showTodos());
}
```

Alter our template:

```angular-html
@if (showTodos()) {
  <app-todos></app-todos>
}
```

Since we are using standalone components, make sure ``Todos`` is added to the ``imports`` array in ``app.ts``:

```angular-ts
imports: [RouterOutlet, Todos],
```

With all these changes, if you rebuild our application and reload when you are prompted to, you should see the "Toggle Todos" button, which creates and destroys our brand new ``Todos`` component. Let's open the dev tools, go to the network tab and click our new button. You should see something like this:

![initial request](/images/pwa-tutorial/part-6/pwa_cache_online.png)

We see that our request was successful. First, we received the data, then our service worker cached it. The initial request took 40 ms to complete. If we click our "Toggle Todos" button twice, another request is sent, which took even longer than the first one. This obviously shows that nothing is being read from the cache, however, the response is cached again.

![initial request](/images/pwa-tutorial/part-6/pwa_cache_online_2.png)

Now set our browser to offline mode in the dev tools and repeat clicking the button twice and we'll see this:

![initial request](/images/pwa-tutorial/part-6/pwa_cache_offline.png)

Notice, that it only took 7 ms to get the response and even though we have no network connection, as it also can be seen due to our offline status indicator next to the buttons, we still have the data. Since our browser knows we do not have network connection, the response is served from the cache instantly, even though we have configured it to wait for 5 seconds. However, if we had network connection and this was a real API that wasn't responding - at least not fast enough - the service worker would've waited for 5 seconds before serving from the cache.

If we go back to online mode and toggle ``Todos``, we're back to actually sending the request and working with real data:

![initial request](/images/pwa-tutorial/part-6/pwa_cache_online_3.png)

I think for demo purposes this is more than enough, but you can create very complex caching policies if you have a need for them, [so make sure to poke around in the dataGroups section of the documentation.](https://angular.dev/ecosystem/service-workers/config#datagroups)
